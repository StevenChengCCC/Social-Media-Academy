## Social Media Academy

Social Media Academy is a learning website that helps people, especially international students and neurodivergent users, understand social media slang and safety concepts across platforms like Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and Discord. Users can browse a curated slang dictionary, submit new slang for review, and climb a contribution leaderboard, all while their privacy is protected through UUID-based identities and an AWS Amplify–hosted architecture.
